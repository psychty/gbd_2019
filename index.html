                The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is one of the most
                comprehensive, epidemiological collaborations worldwide
                describing life expectancy as well as mortality and morbidity
                burden from major diseases and injuries including risk factors
                at local, regional, national, and global levels.

                Data are collected and analysed by a consortium of more than
                7,000 researchers to estimate premature death and disability in
                195 countries, by age and sex, from 1990 to the present (with
                the latest data up to 2019), allowing for comparisons over time,
                across age groups, and in different parts of the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Data are refreshed every two years and with each revision, data
                and methodological innovations are fed into models, annual
                estimates are comprised for 360 diseases and injuries and 85

                In this analysis, which serves to present an overall picture of
                burden of disease in West Sussex, we aim to describe changes in
                life expectancy over time as well as explore the top causes of
                death for those living in West Sussex, comparing to regional and
                national estimates where possible. We also aim to describe

                  (COVID-19) global pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtably alter the trends in ill
                  health and mortality that have been observed in the

              <h2 class="title">Using the global burden of disease â€“ concepts and caveats</h2>
              <p>
                Whilst we explore the leading causes of death in West Sussex,
                and the relative changes in life expectancy, the burden of
                disease can be measured by more than just what kills us and the
                number of people who have died.
              </p>
              <p>
                This figure illustrates the different measures of the burden of
                ill health over the life course of a typical person.
              </p>

                alt="Disability adjusted life years is the sum of years of life lost plus years lived with disability"
              />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In England, when a person dies, their death is certified and
                  registered formally upon the issue of a medical certificate
                  detailing the cause or causes of death; usually within five days of the death occurring.<br /><br />In some cases the cause of death is clear (for example accidents/injuries) but for others it
                  may be much more complicated (for example among those with
                  multiple long term conditions). Cause-specific deaths
                  (discussed later in this analyses) are estimated using
                  statistical modelling and are adjusted to match the all-cause
                  totals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Years of life lost (YLLs) are calculated by subtracting the
                  age at death from the longest possible life expectancy for a
                  person at that age and sex. If the longest life expectancy for
                  males in a given country is 75, and a male dies of cancer at
                  65, this would be 10 years of life lost due to cancer, if a
                  female dies at the same age but the life expectancy for
                  females is 85, this is 20 YLLs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Years lived with disability (YLDs) are the number
                  of years lived in less than ideal health. Some conditions such
                  as influenza last for a few days, whereas epilepsy can
                  last a lifetime. Disability weights reflecting the severity of
                  each condition are developed using a variety of data sources
                  including national surveys, the national cancer registration
                  system, hospital episode statistics and published
                  research studies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are the sum of years of
                  life lost and years lived with disability. This is the best
                  measure to consider the overall impact of a specific cause or
                  group of causes on a population.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The green section (the DALY) is a useful measure because it also
                allows the comparison of acute conditions such as stroke or
                heart attacks with conditions like diabetes or circulatory
                diseases with conditions such as musculoskeletal disorders which
                may not ordinarily cause premature death but none the less
                reduce the quality of someone's life.
              </p>
              <p>
                DALYs use disability weights (0 = perfect health and 1 = death)
                which are generated through consultations with clinicians and
                other experts. This helps to account for those conditions which
                can be well managed.
              </p>
              <p>
                As such, <b>a DALY represents the amount of time in sub-optimal
                health</b> and our goal in public health is to reduce the DALY
                values where possible and improve the chances of individuals
                spending more of their lives in good quality healthy states.

              <p>
                There are a number of caveats and limitations you should
                consider when using these estimates
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The GBD ethos is that an uncertain estimate, even when data
                  are sparse or not available, is preferable to no estimate at
                  all. As a result, you should consider that there is a margin
                  of error when interpreting these results as they are simply
                  estimates or 'best guesses'.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Estimates from the GBD do not compare directly to reported
                  statistics within England (where these are available) as all
                  estimates are constructed using the GBD methodology. Note that
                  figures are rounded to the nearest whole number, and
                  percentages are rounded to the nearest single decimal point.
                  This is to make interpretation of the findings easier to
                  follow but it can mean that some values show as zero when they
                  have a value between 0 and 0.5.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A change in rank does not necessarily mean that a metric for a
                  cause has got better/worse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The GBD diseases/conditions and risks are split and aggregated
                  into hierarchical levels. The cause list is mutually exclusive
                  and collectively exhaustive at every level of aggregation;
                  causes not individually specified are captured in residual
                  categories, such as 'other intestinal infectious diseases'.

              <h2 class="title">What causes the deaths in the county</h2>
              <p>
                In 2019, there were estimated to be 9,353 deaths among those who
                live in West Sussex. As a rate per 100,000 population (a way to
                compare different areas), West Sussex (with a rate of 1,097
                deaths per 100,000 people) had significantly higher mortality
                than in the South East region (903 deaths per 100,000) and
                England overall (900 deaths per 100,000 people).
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2019, almost 90% of deaths (8,342 deaths) in West Sussex were
                caused by non-communicable diseases (these are coloured
                blue/purple in the figure). Communicable, maternal, neonatal and
                nutritional diseases (coloured red on the figure) accounted for
                8% of deaths (741 deaths) and the majority of these are
                respiratory infections. Injuries caused 3% (270 deaths).
              </p>
              <p>Roughly half of the deaths in the county in 2019 were amongst males (4,586 deaths, 49% of all deaths), with 4,767 deaths amongst females. </p>
              <p>
                The figure shows the top 10 causes of deaths in West Sussex, in
                2019. These are the 'level two' cause groups. You can use the
                drop down menu below to toggle between viewing all people or

                <select style = 'margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;' id="select_deaths_sex_filter_button"></select>
              <p>
                In West Sussex, the two largest cases of death accounted for nearly two thirds of deaths in 2019. These were neoplasms (cancers) which were estimated to cause 2,938 deaths, and cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks, strokes, atrial fibrillation and aortic aneurysms) accounting for 2,938 deaths.
              </p>
              <p>There are a number of differences in the top ten causes of death for males and females. Whilst the top two causes are the same for males and females, the third biggest cause of death for males was chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other lung conditions). For females, the third largest cause of death in West Sussex was neurological disorders such as dementia, epilepsy, motor neurone disease, and multiple sclerosis.</p>
              <p>Self harm was the 10th biggest level 2 cause of death overall in West Sussex (72 deaths, around 1% of all deaths in the county) and three quarters of those self-harm and interpersonal violence deaths were among males (53 deaths). For females, however, self-harm does not appear in the top ten level 2 causes of death and is replaced by musculoskeletal disorders as having a greater impact on mortality in West Sussex estimated to be attributable to 48 deaths in 2019 among females. The 48 musculoskeletal deaths amongst females represent almost three quarters of musculoskeletal deaths overall.</p>

               Beyond deaths
              </h2>            
              <p>The table shows the top ten level two causes of ill health for 2019 in West Sussex, with four columns representing the four measures of burden (deaths, YLLs, YLDs and DALYs). This highlights that there are stark differences in ranks of conditions depending on the measure you use.</p>
              <p>For some conditions, the majority of deaths occur at a relatively old age and as such the YLLs (the premature life years lost) may be fairly low, particularly if the condition can be managed well for a number of years, whilst YLDs (years lived with disability) may be relatively high.</p>
              <p>An example of this is the mental disorders group of conditions (which includes schizophrenia, depressive disorder, anxiety, and eating disorders as well as autism spectrum disorder). Mental disorders ranked 20th out of 22 conditions for deaths and YLLs, yet this group of conditions ranks 2nd for years lived with disability indicating that mental disorders impose a substantial burden of disability on the population with those who have these conditions expected to live a large part of their lifetime in 'sub-optimal health'. When using the overall burden, as measured by DALYs, mental disorders ranks 5th out of 22.</p>
              <p>Another example is musculoskeletal conditions which account for very few deaths (66 deaths, or less than 1% of deaths in West Sussex in 2019) but were estimated to be responsible for almost one in four years of life lived with disability (27,820, 22% of YLDs) in West Sussex in 2019.</p></p>
              <p>Other conditions have low years lived with disability and high premature years of life lost. The respiratory infections and tuberculosis disease group includes lower and upper respiratory infections, Otitis media (inflammatory diseases of the middle ear) and Tuberculosis. Based on the findings of the GBD study, people might expect to contract these illnesses early in their lifetimes and suffer for a limited time before dying as a result of the condition.</p>

                Remember, the overall burden as measured by DALYs is the sum of YLLs and YLDs and this does not take into account which aspect (premature death or long life living with the burden of disease) contributes more.</p>
                <p>Based on DALYs, the condition group sense organ diseases (including blindness and visual impairment caused by Glaucoma, Cataract, and Macular degeneration as well as hearing loss) has the equivalent burden (7,847 DALYs) to respiratory infections and tuberculosis (7,973 DALYs).</p>
                <p>An obvious limitation of using DALYs is that the level of disability experienced by individuals will vary from minimal interruption to significant disruption of daily life and dependence on others for care.</p>
                <p>As a result, it is recommended to consider all measures of burden for a given condition to understand how it impacts the population.</p>

                Exploring the detail of burden
              </h2>
              <p>The level two causes of ill health can be further divided into 169 'level three' causes (and in some cases can be broken down even further). Use the drop down menu below to toggle between deaths and the other measures of burden for West Sussex residents (both males and females) in 2019.</p>

              <p>The figure is split into six parts; along the top from, left to right, you can see neoplasms (cancer), chronic respiratory diseases and musculoskeletal disorders. Along the bottom are cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders and lastly the remaining condition groups.</p>
              <p>It is clear that cancer and cardiovascular diseases overall are the biggest causes of mortality. Within these groups it is isch[a]emic heart disease and stroke which are the two biggest level three causes in the cardiovascular group and lung and colon cancers are the biggest causes of death in the neoplasm group. Lower respiratory infections, COPD and dementia are the three leading causes of death outside of cancer and cardiovascular disease. The pattern is similar for deaths and in years of life lost as a measure of premature mortality.</p>
              <p>Musculoskeletal disorders, in comparison, contribute very little to mortality as discussed in the previous section. However, you can see by switching to view years lived with disability that low back pain, neck pain and osteoarthritis are much greater contributors to the burden of disease and dwarf those conditions which tend to be bigger killers.</p>
              <p>Depressive and anxiety disorders, falls, headaches and migraines, diabetes, and hearing loss are all conditions which may not always cause death but nonetheless contribute substantially to the disabilities and sub-optimal health experienced by individuals in West Sussex.</p>
              <p>When combining estimates of premature mortality and disability adjusted life years, individual level three conditions stick out across the condition groups. There are: isch[a]emic heart disease, low back pain, COPD, stroke, lung cancers, and diabetes.</p>

                Has the burden of disease changed over time?
              </h2>
              <p>
             Have things stayed the same, what was the picture like in West Sussex in the last 10 years.
              </p>
              <p>
                To account for differences in population size and demographics,
                the remaining analyses use standardised estimates which detail
                the number (e.g. deaths) per 100,000 population. More information on standardising rates is given in the box below. 
              </p>
                             <p>You can toggle each of the measures of burden from deaths, to DALYs.</p>

  <div class="title">Standardising rates</div>
  <p>
    Looking at crude estimates helps to know what the true impact
    might be for our area (e.g. to anticipate the number of patients a
    service might need to cater for, the number of cases) and this can
    help to plan services.
  </p>
  <p>
    You could compare these crude estimates with those in other areas,
    or over time, to see if things are better in some areas or are
    improving over time, although any differences (or similarities) in
    estimates could be at least in part due the underlying differences
    in populations (e.g. areas with fewer or greater numbers of older
    people, or the sheer size of the population).
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, area A may have recorded 2,000 deaths and area B
    recorded 1,500 deaths. You might think that area A has a much
    bigger issue of mortality than area B. However, if area A has a
    population of 500,000, the rate of deaths would be 400 deaths per
    100,000 population. If area B has a population of 300,000, then
    the rate of deaths is higher in area B (500 per 100,000
    population).

  <h2 class="title"> How does West Sussex compare over time to the South East region and England?</h2>
<p>In this final section we explore how the deaths and other measures of burden in West Sussex compare to national estimates. The figure shows the last ten years of estimated rates per 100,000 for West Sussex for each of the level two burden cause groups with the colour of the dot representing whether the rate was significantly higher, lower, or similar to the rate for either the region or nationally.</p>
<p>As with the other sections, you can also toggle each of the measures of burden from deaths, to DALYs. Hover over a dot to see more information appear under the figure.</p>

<p>For the most part, West Sussex estimated burden is similar to that of regional and national estimates; particularly when viewing <b>age standardised</b> rates.</p>
<p class = 'signposter'>Age standardising not only controls for the number of people in an area but also the age structure of a population. As some conditions and outcomes are more likely among older age groups, you might expect to find the burden of disease higher in West Sussex as it has a relatively older age structure compared to the South East and England overall. Age standardising helps to remove the potential confounding effect that age has.</p>

<p>For example, deaths caused by neoplasms (cancer) have been estimated to be consistently significantly higher than in England overall, but this difference disappears when you look at age standardised differences.</p>

<p>Looking at all cause deaths, in West Sussex they are significantly higher when looking at the all age rate. However, when the estimates are age standardised, West Sussex all cause deaths are significantly lower compared to national rates.</p>
